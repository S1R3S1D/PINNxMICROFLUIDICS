# PINNs and Microfluidics
A Repo for the study of Physics Informed Neural Networks implementations in Microfluidics  

## PINNs  

[PINN](https://github.com/S1R3S1D/PINNxMICROFLUIDICS/blob/main/PINN_Intro.ipynb) is a basic implementation of PINN in PyTorch  
[2D PINN](https://github.com/S1R3S1D/PINNxMICROFLUIDICS/blob/main/2D_PINN.ipynb) is an implementation of a PINN in 2 Dimensions in PyTorch  
[NSFnet](https://github.com/S1R3S1D/PINNxMICROFLUIDICS/blob/main/Laminar_Flow_PINN.ipynb) is an simplified implementation of Velocity-Pressure Navier Stokes Flow net in 2 Dimensions for a Laminar Flow between two infinite Plates with a pressure gradient  
[Couette Flow](https://github.com/S1R3S1D/PINNxMICROFLUIDICS/blob/main/Couette_Flow_NSFnet.ipynb) is an implementaton of a Couette + Pressure Driven Flow with NSFNET in 2 Dimensions
